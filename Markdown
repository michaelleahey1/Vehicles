This is a list of cars, bikes, and trucks.
I used the getters and setters to merge the main class to the car, truck, and bike classes.
This file also used spring boot to link to the generic HTML file.
Saving application and may include something like boats for more practice.
Included the boat class for practice and changed the system.out to logger.info.
Logger.info caused several problems before finally working. Kelso indicated people should use
logger.info instead system.out.
Also blocked out the toString override method, it wasn't needed for this project.
Updated the pom.xml file to bring in the the <packaging>jar</packaging> below the parent class in between artifact
and version.
Remember to go to maven and click on package to bring in the Jar.
Under the properties section in pom.xml add <start-class>com.example.demo.VehicleApplication</start-class>.
the start class tags you enter the .com then .name of your main class.

You got this wrong on the quiz: @RequestMapping( value = "/Bikes", method = RequestMethod.GET) remember "/Bikes"
is the command that brings this into the website. You knew this ya moron.
